## Cake.MonoApiTools

A set of aliases for http://cakebuild.net to help with running Mono's API Tools (mono-api-info, mono-api-diff, mono-api-html) for creating XML files with API Info from .NET assemblies, and creating XML, HTML and Markdown diffs of API Info files.

You can easily reference Cake.MonoApiTools directly in your build script via a cake addin:

```csharp
#addin nuget:?package=Cake.MonoApiTools
```

### Aliases

```csharp
// for a single assembly
MonoApiInfo(FilePath dotNetAssembly, FilePath outputFile);
MonoApiInfo(FilePath dotNetAssembly, FilePath outputFile, MonoApiInfoToolSettings settings);

// for multiple assemblies
MonoApiInfo(FilePath[] assemblies, FilePath outputFile);
MonoApiInfo(FilePath[] assemblies, FilePath outputFile, MonoApiInfoToolSettings settings);
```

```csharp
// for exporting an XML diff
MonoApiDiff(FilePath previousApiInfoFile, FilePath newApiInfoFile, FilePath outputFile);
MonoApiDiff(FilePath previousApiInfoFile, FilePath newApiInfoFile, FilePath outputFile, MonoApiDiffToolSettings settings);
```

```csharp
// for exporting an HTML diff
MonoApiHtml(FilePath previousApiInfoFile, FilePath newApiInfoFile, FilePath outputFile);
MonoApiHtml(FilePath previousApiInfoFile, FilePath newApiInfoFile, FilePath outputFile, MonoApiHtmlToolSettings settings);
// for exporting a colorized HTML diff
MonoApiHtmlColorized(FilePath previousApiInfoFile, FilePath newApiInfoFile, FilePath outputFile);

// for exporting an Markdown diff
MonoApiMarkdown(FilePath previousApiInfoFile, FilePath newApiInfoFile, FilePath outputFile);
// for exporting a colorized Markdown diff
MonoApiMarkdownColorized(FilePath previousApiInfoFile, FilePath newApiInfoFile, FilePath outputFile);
```
